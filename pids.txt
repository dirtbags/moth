I know you've done some work on this already but I have to get this idea down someplace.

I would like to, as much as possible, not have the same data in two different places. So here are my proposals for doing this in the filesystem backend.

We could implement all of these at the same time, although I don't know why we'd want to

### The obvious way
* [ ] Make the `teams` directory full of directories again and not files
* [ ] Move team names to `teams/$id/name`
* [ ] Define a new file called `teams/$id/map` which contains an ID that this maps to. It will only be followed once.
* [ ] When writing anything with team id, resolve any maps first

### The clever way
* [ ] Allow `teams/$id` to be a symbolic link to another team file
* [ ] When writing anything with team id, resolve any symlinks first

### The easy way

* [ ] Line 2 of a team file, optionally, contains a team id to map to
* [ ] When writing anything with a team id, resolve any maps
