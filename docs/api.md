Moth APIs
=======

This document covers the following interfaces:

* HTTP Endpoints: what the Moth client sends the Moth server
* Puzzle executable: how the transpiler communicates with executables that provide puzzles
* Category executable: how the transpiler communicates with executables that provide categories
* Provider executable: how Moth communicates with things that provide puzzles (like the transpiler)

The Puzzle, Category, and Provider executalbes are all very closely related, since each is a subset of the next.

----

Here's a bad diagram of how this all fits together. I don't know if this is going to help at all. Please submit a merge request with something better.

# HTTP Endpoints

The Moth server accepts
standard HTTP `GET` and `POST`.

Parameters may be encoded with standard `GET` query parameters
(like `GET /endpoint?a=1&b=2`),
or with `POST` as `application/x-www-form-encoded` data.

## `/state`

Returns the current Moth event state as a JSON object.

### Parameters
* `id`: team ID (optional)

### Return

```js
{
    "Config": {
        "Devel": false // true means this is a development server
    },
    "TeamNames": {
        "self": "Requesting team name", // Only if regestered team id is a provided
        "0": "Team 1 Name",
        "1": "Team 2 Name"
        // ...
    },
    "PointsLog": [
        [1602679698, "0", "category", 1] // epochTime, teamID, category, points
        // ...
    ],
    "Puzzles": {
        "category": [1, 2, 3, 6] // list of unlocked puzzles for category
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Example HTTP transaction

#### Request

```
GET /state HTTP/1.0

```

#### Response

This response has been reflowed for readability:
an actual on-wire response would not have newlines or indentation.

```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"Config":
  {"Devel":false},
  "TeamNames":{
      "0":"Mike and Jack",
      "12":"Team 2",
      "4":"Team 8"
    },
    "PointsLog":[
        [1602702696,"0","nocode",1],
        [1602702705,"0","sequence",1],

        "sequence":[1,2,8,16,19],
        "steg":[1]
    }
}
```

## `/register`

Registers a name to a team ID.

This is only required once per team,
but user interfaces may find it less confusing to users
to present a "login" page.
For this reason "this team is already registered"
does not return an error.

### Parameters
* `id`: team ID
* `name`: team name

### Return

An object inspired by [JSend](https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend):

```json
{
    "status": "success/fail/error",
    "data": {
        "short": "short description",
        "description": "long description"
    }
}
```

### Example HTTP transaction

#### Request

```
POST /register HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 26

id=b387ca98&name=dirtbags
```

#### Repsonse

```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length=86

{"status":"success","data":{"short":"registered","description":"Team ID registered"}}
```


## `/answer`

Submits an answer for points.

If the answer is wrong, no points are awarded ðŸ˜‰

### Parameters
* `id`: team ID
* `category`: along with `points`, uniquely identifies a puzzle
* `points`: along with `category`, uniquely identifies a puzzle

### Return

An object inspired by [JSend](https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend):

    "status": "success/fail/error",
    "data": {
        "short": "short description",

    }
}
```

# Puzzle

A puzzle contains one question and one or more associated answers.
Puzzles are not aware of their point value: this is set by the category they are in.

Puzzle executables must be named `mkpuzzle`.


## `mkpuzzle puzzle`

    puzzles/category3/1 $ ./mkpuzzle puzzle
    {JSON PUZZLE OBJECT}

Also see [JSON Puzzle Object](#json-puzzle-object)


## `mkpuzzle file {filename}`

    puzzles/category3/1 $ ./mkpuzzle file attachment.txt
    This is an attachment file! It's just plain text for this example. Many attachments are JPEGs.


## `mkpuzzle answer {answer}`

    puzzles/category3/1 $ ./mkpuzzle answer "cow goes moo"
    {"Correct":false}



# Category

Categories are collections of puzzles.
Each puzzle has a unique point value, determined by the category.

Category executables must be called `mkcategory`.

## `mkcategory inventory`

    puzzles/category2 $ ./mkcategory inventory
    {"Puzzles": [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100]}


## `mkcategory puzzle {points}`

    puzzles/category2 $ ./mkcategory puzzle 1
    {JSON PUZZLE OBJECT}

Also see [JSON Puzzle Object](#json-puzzle-object)


## `mkcategory file {points} {filename}`

    puzzles/category2 $ ./mkcategory file 1 attachment.txt
    This is an attachment file's contents!


## `mkcategory answer {points} {answer}`

    puzzles/category2 $ ./mkcategory answer 1 "cow goes moo"
    {"Correct":false}



# Provider API

This is how Claire gets her dynamic graders.

*Notice: this is not complete in the code base!*
I'm writing here how it *should* work.
If anybody wants this,
please let me know,
and I'll finish the code.

This could ostensibly be expanded to call HTTP servers,
with the four endpoints described here.
If somebody were to want such a thing.

## `provider inventory`

    $ provider inventory
    {
      "category1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30],
      "category2": [20, 40, 70, 150]
    }

## `provider puzzle {category} {points}`

    $ provider puzzle category1 20
    {JSON PUZZLE OBJECT}

Also see [JSON Puzzle Object](#json-puzzle-object)


## `provider file {category} {points} {filename}`

    $ provider file category1 20 attachment.txt
    This is an attachment! Yay!

##  `provider answer {category} {points} {answer}`

    $ provider answer category1 20 "cow goes moo"
    {"Correct":true}
