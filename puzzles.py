        :param path: An optional path to a puzzle directory. The point value for the puzzle is taken
                     from the puzzle directories name (it must be an integer greater than zero).
                     Within this directory, we expect:
            (optional) A puzzle.moth file in RFC2822 format. The puzzle will get its attributes

                       Markdown format.

                       that takes a single positional argument (this puzzle object).

        always returns a list. Certain keys, however behave differently:
          - Keys in Puzzle.SINGULAR_KEYS can only have one value, and writing to these overwrites
            that value.
          - The keys 'hidden', 'file', and 'resource' all create a new PuzzleFile object that
            gets added under the 'files' key.
          - The 'answer' also adds a new hash under the the 'hash' key.
