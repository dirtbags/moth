                        <h2>How we compute scores</h2>

                        <p>
                                The contest is made up of multiple categories.
                                Each category is worth one point toward the total score;
                                your team's score in a category is the fraction of the total points unlocked so far in that category.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                The team that has 30% of the points
                                in each of five categories has 1.5 points, whereas the team that
                                has 80% of the points in only one category has 0.8 points.      It is
                                typically better to have a few points in many categories, than
                                many points in a few categories.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                When points are unlocked in a category,
                                every other team's score in that category goes down until they too score that point.
                                Unlike previous years, however,
                                unlocking points is the only way to reduce another team's score.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                There are two main ways to make points: <em>puzzles</em>
                                and <em>tokens</em>.    Your contest may have other ways to make
                                points: these will either be automatic, or explained elsewhere.
                        </p>
