Summary: Using JavaScript Input Helpers
Author: neale
Script: helpers.js
Answer: helper

MOTH only takes static answers:
you can't, for instance, write code to check answer correctness.
But you can provide as many correct answers as you like in a single puzzle.

This page has an associated `helpers.js` script
you can include to assist with input formatting,
so people aren't confused about how to enter an answer.

You could also write your own JavaScript to validate things.

This is just a demonstration page.
You will probably only want one of these in a page,
to avoid confusing people.
