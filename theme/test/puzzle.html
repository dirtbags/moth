        <!-- style tells the client whether to inject its own stylesheet.
        
            By default, a client will try to style a puzzle using its own stylesheet.
            If you want to override this behavior, provide "style" with
            content="override".
            Omitting this meta element is the same as content="inherit".
        -->
        <meta name="moth.style" content="inherit"> 
        
        
        <!-- moth.answerhash is used for the "possibly correct" check.
            
            This is the first 8 characters of the hex-encoded sha1 checksum of the answer.
            If you have multiple acceptable answers, provide multiple answerhash elements.
        -->
        <meta name="moth.answerhash" content="2c26b46b">
        
        <!-- author specifies the author of this puzzle.

            If you have multiple authors, specify multiple meta elements,
            one author per element.
        -->
        <meta name="author" content="Neale Pickett">

        <h1>Example Puzzle</h1>
        <p>
            This is an example puzzle, yo.
            You can put whatever you want in the HTML.
            If you do crazy tricks, it might break the client, though.
