## [Unreleased]

## [v3.6.2] - 2020-11-17
### Fixed
- Removed the "disabled" log, which was getting sent out way too frequently,
  and caused outages due to poor logic handling event queues

### Fixed
- Timestamps on event log entries
- Team names logged in event log on registration

## [v3.6.0] - 2020-11-11

## [v3.5.1] - 2020-03-16

## [v3.5.0] - 2020-03-13
### Changed
- We are now using SHA256 instead of djb2hash
### Added
- URL parameter to points.json to allow returning only the JSON for a single
  team by its team id (e.g., points.json?id=abc123).
- A CONTRIBUTING.md to describe expectations when contributing to MOTH
- Include basic metadata in mothballs
- add_script_stream convenience function allows easy script addition to puzzle
- Autobuild Docker images to test buildability
- Extract and use X-Forwarded-For headers in mothd logging
- Mothballs can now specify `X-Answer-Pattern` header fields, which allow `*`
  at the beginning, end, or both, of an answer. This is `X-` because we
  are hoping to change how this works in the future.
